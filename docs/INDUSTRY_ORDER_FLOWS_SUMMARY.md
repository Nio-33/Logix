# Industry-Specific Order Flows Summary

## Current System Assessment

### ❌ **What's Missing in Current Implementation**

1. **Generic Order Model**: Single `source` field (web, mobile, api, phone) doesn't capture industry-specific origins
2. **One-Size-Fits-All Status Workflow**: Generic statuses don't reflect industry-specific processes
3. **No Order Type Classification**: Cannot differentiate between business models
4. **Missing Industry Metadata**: No capture of industry-specific requirements

### ✅ **What's Currently Working**

1. **Basic Order Structure**: Core order fields are well-designed
2. **Role-Based Access**: Good security model for different user types
3. **API Architecture**: Solid REST API foundation
4. **Database Design**: Firestore structure supports extensibility

```

### 5. **Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Orders**
```
Client → Client System → Logix API → 3PL Warehouse → Client's Customer
```

**Unique Characteristics:**
- **Source**: Client portals, WMS integrations, API integrations
- **Client Data**: Client ID, service type, fulfillment center
- **Service Types**: Fulfillment, storage, cross-dock, returns
- **Billing**: Per-order, per-item, monthly billing models
- **Integration**: Multiple client systems, data format handling

**Enhanced Workflow:**
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → RECEIVED → INVENTORIED → PROCESSING → PICKED → PACKED → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
```

## Data Structure Enhancements Needed

### 1. **Order Type Classification**
```python
class OrderType(Enum):
    ECOMMERCE_DIRECT = "ecommerce_direct"
    ECOMMERCE_MARKETPLACE = "ecommerce_marketplace"
    RETAIL_PURCHASE_ORDER = "retail_po"
    FOOD_DELIVERY_CUSTOMER = "food_delivery_customer"
    MANUFACTURING_PRODUCTION = "manufacturing_production"
    THIRD_PARTY_FULFILLMENT = "3pl_fulfillment"
```

### 2. **Enhanced Source Tracking**
```python
class OrderSource(Enum):
    # E-commerce
    SHOPIFY = "shopify"
    AMAZON_MARKETPLACE = "amazon_marketplace"
    
    # Retail
    EDI_SYSTEM = "edi_system"
    VENDOR_PORTAL = "vendor_portal"
    
    # Food Delivery
    UBER_EATS = "uber_eats"
    RESTAURANT_POS = "restaurant_pos"
    
    # Manufacturing
    ERP_SYSTEM = "erp_system"
    MES_SYSTEM = "mes_system"
    
    # 3PL
    CLIENT_PORTAL = "client_portal"
    WMS_INTEGRATION = "wms_integration"
```

### 3. **Industry-Specific Metadata**
```python
@dataclass
class EnhancedOrder:
    # Core fields
    order_id: str
    customer_id: str
    
    # Industry classification
    order_type: OrderType
    order_source: OrderSource
    industry_category: str
    
    # Industry-specific data (conditional)
    ecommerce_data: Optional[EcommerceOrderData] = None
    retail_data: Optional[RetailOrderData] = None
    food_delivery_data: Optional[FoodDeliveryOrderData] = None
    manufacturing_data: Optional[ManufacturingOrderData] = None
